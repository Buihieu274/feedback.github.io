       </pre>

<pre>                The first person to give me feedback is Nhat, he said that this game content was simple and 
            similar to many games on the market, so it was difficult to compete. I think that his comment is 
            correct because I also notice it but I will add more play approaching and many other interesting 
            features to the game. In addition, I will focus on the graphics and the satisfaction of players
            because that is what helps players to go with the game for a long time.  
    
            The next person is Phuc, he said that this game was only short-lived because this game genre 
            was fast-growing and easy to catch. I totally agree with him but if the game market develops 
            quickly, I will definitely try to develop following it in order to upgrade the game and myself with 
            new features and technologies.

            To sum up, I usually listen to everyoneâ€™s feedback and improve the production in the future 
            because they are also my customers.
